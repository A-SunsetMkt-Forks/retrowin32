# retrowin32 on x86-64

This collects notes on running retrowin32 "natively" on x86-64 Rosetta on Macs.

See blog post summarizing this work:
https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2023/08/x86-x64-aarch64.html

To build, run

```
$ ./build-rosetta.sh
```

## Wine background

The main post to get things started was
[this big description of the hack](https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2019-December/156602.html).

## Executable layout

Print pagezero info:

```
$ otool -l the/binary
```

Dump sections in a .rlib:

```
$ size -mlx path/to/rlib
```

## LDT

We use two LDT entries:

1. To jump between 32 and 64 bit code. A Darwin file that has some notes on
   using LDT to trampoline between 32 and 64-bit.

2. The FS register used for thread local storage.

## Trampoline assembly

We need some snippets of assembly embedded into memory at low (32-bit)
addresses.

We cannot use Rust's `asm!` related macros to generate it directly, as it
generates code at higher addresses. I tinkered a bit with trying to convice
`global_asm!` to emit a span of labels that I could then snip out at build time
but I couldn't figure it out. (We also need both 32-bit and 64-bit assembly.)

Instead, I wrote the relevant assembly by hand in some .s files, and the script
dump-asm.sh prints their source bytes such that they can be embedded by hand in
the Rust code. We need to embed some runtime values into the generated assembly
anyway.

Run it like:

```
$ ./win32/src/print-asm.sh
```

PS: I would have preferred Intel assembly, but I couldn't figure out the
instruction names for the far call/returns...
