# retrowin32 on x86-64

This collects notes on running retrowin32 "natively" on x86-64 Rosetta on Macs.

See blog post summarizing this work:
https://neugierig.org/software/blog/2023/08/x86-x64-aarch64.html

To build, run

```
$ ./build-rosetta.sh
```

## Wine background

The main post to get things started was
[this big description of the hack](https://www.winehq.org/pipermail/wine-devel/2019-December/156602.html).

## Executable layout

Print pagezero info:

```
$ otool -l the/binary
```

Dump sections in a .rlib:

```
$ size -mlx path/to/rlib
```

## LDT

We use two LDT entries:

1. To jump between 32 and 64 bit code. A Darwin file that has some notes on
   using LDT to trampoline between 32 and 64-bit.

2. The FS register used for thread local storage.
